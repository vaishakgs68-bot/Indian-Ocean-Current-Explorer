# Indian-Ocean-Current-Explorer
To develop an interactive Leaflet.js map visualizing major surface ocean currents in the Indian Ocean region, using vector flow data (u/v components) from satellite or reanalysis datasets. 
The map will show current directions, magnitudes, and variability across seasons (e.g., monsoon vs. inter-monsoon), providing users with an intuitive way to explore Indian Ocean dynamics.
